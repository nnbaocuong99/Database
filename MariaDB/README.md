#### 1. Download [MySQL Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

> **Warning** Unlike the standard MySQL Installer, the smaller web-community version does not bundle any MySQL applications, but downloads only the MySQL products you choose to install.

#### 2. Determine the setup type to use for the initial installation of MySQL products. For example:
   - Developer Default: Provides a setup type that includes the selected version of MySQL Server and other MySQL tools related to MySQL development, such as MySQL Workbench.
   - Server Only: Provides a setup for the selected version of MySQL Server without other products.
   - Custom: Enables you to select any version of MySQL Server and other MySQL products.

Install the server instance (and products) and then begin the server configuration by following the onscreen instructions. For more information about each individual step, see [Section 2.3.3.3.1, “MySQL Server Configuration with MySQL Installer”.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-installer-workflow.html#mysql-installer-workflow-server)
